# Uni---second-year-assignments
This repository contains some of the coding assignments I undertook as part of my second year studies. My overall result for all the assignments in this folder was **92%**.

The Scientific Computing worksheet shows a range of tasks that I am able to solve in Python.

These are intended to showcase the type of work I have done in Python; and for those interested in seeing how physicists use Python to model certain
scenarios.
