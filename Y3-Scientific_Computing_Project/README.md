This folder contains my third year scientific computing project, which was to simulate a transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter, and then a gravity assist from Jupiter out of the solar system by using python to calculate the solutions to the differential equations of motion.

The worksheet showcases some basic methods needed for this course, and received a score of 92%.

The report outlines the key steps taken to create and optimise the transfer orbit and gravity assist. The project recieved an overall score of 80%, with the module score 82.33%.
