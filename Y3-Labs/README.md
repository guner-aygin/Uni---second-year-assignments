This folder contains the code used when undertaking two different laboratory-based projects. The first was investigating the phenomenon of ***Electron Spin Resonance*** (ESR), and the second was the investigation into ***X-Ray diffraction*** (XRD) of different materials. 

Both projects required us to fit models to the data to come to draw a scientific conclusion of the particular characteristics/ phenomena being investigated.

Attached are also a lab report for the ESR project, and a poster of the XRD project. The final grade for the combinaton of the two projects was **74%**.
