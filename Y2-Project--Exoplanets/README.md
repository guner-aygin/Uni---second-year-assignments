## Year 2 Lab Project: Simulating the transit of planets, their satellites and starspots

This was my second year physics project and spanned 11 weeks in duration. The goal of this project was to create a grid-based simulation of an
exoplanet orbiting a star. 

When an exoplanet passess infront of a star it blocks a portion of light from the star. This tiny difference in stellar luminosity is captured by space 
telescopes such as Kepler. To test our simulation, we used real data of the exoplanet **HD 209458b** and compared it with our simulation.

As a bonus, we also attempted simulating a starspot as well as a satellite orbiting the planet, and seeing if it would be detectable.

This project recieved an overall **1st**, with my preliminary report recieving 90%, the highest of my cohort.
